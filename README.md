# Technical Internship - Euranova - Data Scientist

## Project: Creation of an Audit Proposal to Optimize Energy Consumption and Performance of AI Technologies

During this internship, I had the opportunity to deepen my technical expertise across several domains, including:

- **Network Architecture**
- **Software and Hardware Optimization**
- **Machine Learning**

My primary task involved designing the structure and key steps for an **audit proposal** that links hardware and software components to enhance **energy efficiency** and **performance** for Euranovaâ€™s AI technologies. Developing this audit and commercial proposal framework provided me with valuable experience in diverse technical areas and reinforced my understanding of cross-functional optimization strategies.

A big thank you to my internship supervisor, Alice Martzloff, and to all the skilled professionals I had the pleasure of working with!
