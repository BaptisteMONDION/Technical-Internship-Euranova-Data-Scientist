# Technical Internship - Euranova - Data Scientist

Creation of an Audit Proposal Linking Hardware and Software to Optimize Energy Consumption and Performance of Euranova's AI Technologies

During this internship, I was able to deepen my technical knowledge in areas such as network architecture, software, hardware, and more broadly, machine learning. Developing the structure for the steps that will make up the audit and the commercial proposal allowed me to gain expertise in various fields.

A big thank you to my internship supervisor Alice Martzloff and to all the diverse and talented professionals I had the opportunity to meet!
